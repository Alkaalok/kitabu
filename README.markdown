DESCRIPTION:
------------

A framework for creating e-books from Markdown/Textile text markup using Ruby.
Using the Prince PDF generator, you'll be able to get high quality PDFs.

While Prince is too expensive (495USD for a single user license), the
free version available at [http://www.princexml.com/download/](http://www.princexml.com/download/) generates
a PDF with a small logo on the first page, which is removed when sent
to a printer.

SAMPLES:
--------

I published two PDFs (portuguese only) exploring lots of features. Check it out:

* http://howtocode.com.br/downloads/rails-application-templates.pdf

FEATURES:
---------

* Write PDF using Markdown or Textile text markup
* Book layout support
* Syntax highlight theme based on Textmate
* Generate a PDF with a single rake task
* Table of Contents automatically generated from chapter titles
