h2. Ruby

Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, general purpose object-oriented programming language that combines syntax inspired by Perl with Smalltalk-like features. Ruby originated in Japan during the mid-1990s and was initially developed and designed by Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto.

Ruby supports multiple programming paradigms, including functional, object oriented, imperative and reflection. It also has a dynamic type system and automatic memory management; it is therefore similar in varying respects to Python, Perl, Lisp, Dylan, and CLU.

In its current, official implementation, written in C, Ruby is a single-pass interpreted language. There is currently no specification of the Ruby language, so the original implementation is considered to be the de facto reference. As of 2008, there are a number of complete or upcoming alternative implementations of the Ruby language, including YARV, JRuby, Rubinius, IronRuby, and MacRuby, each of which takes a different approach, with JRuby and IronRuby providing just-in-time compilation functionality.

The language was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto, who started working on Ruby on February 24, 1993, and released it to the public in 1995. "Ruby" was named as a gemstone because of a joke within Matsumoto's circle of friends alluding to the name of the Perl programming language.[1]

As of June 2008, the latest stable version of the reference implementation is 1.8.7. Apart from the reference, several other virtual machines are being developed for Ruby. These include JRuby, a port of Ruby to the Java platform, IronRuby, an implementation for the .NET Framework produced by Microsoft, and Rubinius, an interpreter modeled after self-hosting Smalltalk virtual machines.

h3. Examples

The following examples can be run in a Ruby shell such as Interactive Ruby Shell or saved in a file and run from the command line by typing @ruby [filename]@.

Classic Hello world example:

	syntax(ruby). puts "Hello World!"
	
Some basic Ruby code:

	syntax(ruby). # Everything, including a literal, is an object, so this works:
	-199.abs                                                # 199
	"ruby is cool".length                                   # 12
	"Rick Astley".index("c")                                # 2
	"Nice Day Isn't It?".downcase.split(//).sort.uniq.join  # " '?acdeinsty"

Some more Ruby code:

file. hello_world.rb

    syntax(ruby). puts "Linking to an external file"
