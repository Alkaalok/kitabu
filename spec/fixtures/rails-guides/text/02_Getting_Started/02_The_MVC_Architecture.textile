h3. The MVC Architecture

Rails is organized around the Model, View, Controller architecture, usually just called MVC. MVC benefits include:

* Isolation of business logic from the user interface
* Ease of keeping code DRY
* Making it clear where different types of code belong for easier maintenance

h4. Models

A model represents the information (data) of the application and the rules to manipulate that data. In the case of Rails, models are primarily used for managing the rules of interaction with a corresponding database table. In most cases, one table in your database will correspond to one model in your application. The bulk of your applicationâ€™s business logic will be concentrated in the models.
